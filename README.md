# harris_corner_detector
This program implement the Harris algorithm for corner detection.
using the Sobel filter to extract the derivatives of the image in X axis and the Y axis.

# Requirements
- python 3.7 (tested)
- numpy library
- scipy library
- cv2 library
- skimage

# Walk through
there is an image from google, just for the example.
set the master/ slave flag to 0 or 1 (if using with image stiching other wise can earase the partition).
